This repository demonstrates a less common Python error scenario.  The `bug.py` file contains code that results in a `ZeroDivisionError`.  This error occurs specifically when the input `x` to the function is 0, even though a seemingly appropriate if/else block is in place. The `bugSolution.py` file shows a solution.  This is a useful example to highlight the importance of comprehensive error handling, especially when dealing with potential divisions by zero.
